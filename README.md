-PLP with infinite scroll, searchbar for filter with brand , model or both,  and change color when you do hover in product.Click in the product navigate to the pdp product.

-PDP with photo, details/description, selects for color and storage and button for add to the cart.When you add to the cart, an alert shows during 3 seconds to notice you that 
 the product was added to the cart. if you don´t select color and storage, the button was disabled to avoid errors.
